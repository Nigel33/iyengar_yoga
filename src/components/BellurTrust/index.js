                Bellur Krishnamachar & Seshamma Smaraka Niddhi Trust (BKSSNT or also known as the
                Bellur Trust) was formed with a vision to improve the living standards of Gurujiâ€™s ancestral
                village of Bellur in the Kolar district of Karnataka, including the children of nearby villages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the Bellur Trust which Guruji established led to a transformation of the village. He
                built a hospital, India's first temple dedicated to Patanjali, a free school that supplies
                uniforms, books, and a hot lunch for the children of Bellur and its surrounding villages, a
                secondary school, and a college.
